Theme Name: Sassy_s
Theme URI: https://github.com/JJSpringer/Sassy_s
Author: J.J. Springer
Author URI: http://jjsfolio.com
Description: This is a version of Automattic's _s starter theme that is configured to work with Sass and Compass. Just set your watch folder to the Sassy_s theme folder. This project was inspired by Shane Osbourne's article on wptuts located here: http://wp.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creative-coding/cross-platform-sass-and-compass-in-wordpress/ When editing this theme, please only edit using Sass instead of editing the style.css file. Hope this helps someone out there!
